# Bullet-Hell-Game
In this project I created a bullet hell game using Python. The program creates a window that the player can move their character in. The player has 3 lives to dodge all the incoming projectiles on screen and a win or lose screen will show up depending on if they lose all their lives by the end of the sequence or not.
